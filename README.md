# Biomarker Invaders

**Biomarker Invaders** is a browser-based game inspired by classic *Space Invaders*.  
Instead of shooting aliens, you identify the correct biomarkers for different translational research programs.

## How to Play
- Use **← / →** arrow keys to move the antibody shooter.  
- Press **Space** to fire.  
- Hit only the biomarkers relevant to the current program:
  - Correct hits **increase sensitivity** and add points.
  - Incorrect hits **reduce specificity**.
- Power-ups:
  - **QC** → Improves specificity for 10 seconds.  
  - **Block** → Reduces background noise.  
  - **Controls** → Restores sensitivity.  

If sensitivity or specificity falls below 60%, the trial fails. Clear a wave to advance to the next level.

## Programs Included
- **NSCLC — EGFR targeted**  
- **Melanoma — BRAF V600**  
- **GI — MSI-H / dMMR**  
- **Breast/Gastric — HER2+**
