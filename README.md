# Biomarker Invaders

A browser mini‑game inspired by classic Space Invaders. You play as an **antibody** and tag the correct **biomarkers** for a given translational program while balancing **specificity** and **sensitivity**.

## How to Play

**Desktop**

* ← / → to move
* Space to fire
* P to pause

**Mobile / Tablet**

* On‑screen buttons (◀ ▶ FIRE PAUSE) appear automatically
* Tap and hold to move or rapid‑fire
* Best in landscape

## Rules

* Hitting on‑program biomarkers increases **sensitivity** and adds points.
* Hitting off‑program labels reduces **specificity**.
* If either metric drops below **60%**, the trial fails.
* Clear a wave to advance to the next level.

## Programs

* **NSCLC** — EGFR targeted (L858R, Ex19del, T790M, G719A, L861Q)
* **Melanoma** — BRAF V600
* **GI** — MSI‑H / dMMR
* **Breast/Gastric** — HER2+

## Power‑ups (falling pickups)

* **QC** — Tightens specificity for 10 s and +100 points
* **Block** — Reduces background noise for 10 s and +100 points
* **Ctrl** — Restores sensitivity and +150 points

*(New)* Power‑ups are **larger** on phones and have a high‑contrast outline so they’re easier to see and collect.

## Notes

* Designed for outreach/education in **biomarkers** and **translational science**.
* Touch support is built‑in; desktop keyboard still works.
